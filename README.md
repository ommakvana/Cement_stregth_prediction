# Cement_stregth_prediction
This project aims to predict the compressive strength of cement using a regression model. Compressive strength is a critical property of concrete that influences its quality and durability. By accurately predicting compressive strength, construction professionals can optimize concrete mix designs and ensure the structural integrity of buildings and infrastructure projects.


DATASET:- The dataset used in this project contains various factors that may affect the compressive strength of cement, such as the composition of cement mixtures, curing conditions, and age of samples. Each instance in the dataset includes features like cement, slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, and age, along with the corresponding compressive strength.


Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
